    2. Once signed up, they have the option to purchase tokens, which serve as the currency within the application.

    3. These tokens can then be redeemed to generate various elements of a blog post:
        - SEO-friendly titles
        - Optimized meta descriptions
        - High-quality blog content

By utilizing this token system, the application provides a streamlined way for users to produce search engine-optimized blog posts efficiently and effectively.
